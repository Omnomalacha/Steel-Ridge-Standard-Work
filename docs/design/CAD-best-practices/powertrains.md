# Powertrains
Powertrains are how we define dimensions pertaining to the moving aspects of the robot. This includes but is not limited to; Belt lengths, Gear sizes/ratios, and motor positioning.
Powertrain sketches should be a part of a subsytems mastersketch **if it directly effects position of major parts of the robot**, like rollers. Otherwise, Powertrains should have their own sketch in the subsystems part studio.
## Pulleys
#### Sketching pulleys
To sketch a pulley, simply create a center point construction circle where you want a pulley to be.
#### Defining pulleys
To define it first make sure you have an origin cube in your part studio. Then, use the dimension tool and type #pulley. A function that reads #pulleyPD5mm() should appear in small menu. 
After clicking on #pulleyPD5mm(),type the number of teeth you want in between the parenthesis. 
#pulleyPD5mm(24) would result in the diameter of a 24 toothed pulley.

**Note:** Make sure to use commercially available teeth numbers or ones we have on hand, commonly 15, 18, and 24. 
## Belts
#### Sketching a belt
To sketch a belt, you must first have two pulleys defined to put the belt between. Make a construction line that is coincident to the center of each of the pulleys. Make two more construction lines, one  on either side of the center line, and make them each tangent to both pulleys. 
#### Defining Belt lengths
